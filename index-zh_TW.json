When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/zh_TW/josm/start-josm/#--find-the-josm-install-file-on-your-computer.-double-click-it-to-begin-setup.@@@@-   Find the JOSM install file on your computer.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/zh_TW/beginner/start-osm/#--select-from-the-menu-on-the-left-what-type-of-location-it-is-that-you-are-adding-to-the-map.-you-can-then-fill-in-the-appropriate-form-with-the-location's-name-and-other-information.@@@@-   Select from the menu on the left what type of location it is that you are adding to the map.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/zh_TW/beginner/start-osm/#--now-that-you-have-seen-what-the-main-website-looks-like,-you-can-register-for-a-username-and-password-and-make-your-first-additions-to-the-map.@@@@-   Now that you have seen what the main website looks like, you can register for a username and password and make your first additions to the map.":{},"/zh_TW/josm/start-josm/#--on-the-left-side,-click-the-icon-that-looks-like-a-paint-can-and-paint-brush.@@@@-   On the left side, click the icon that looks like a paint can and paint brush.":{},"/zh_TW/coordination/remote/#take-a-few-minutes-to-look-at-each-of-these---just-a-quick-read-so-you-know-roughly-what-we-are-talking-about,-and-where-to-refer-back-to-when-you-need-to:@@@@Take a few minutes to look at each of these - just a quick read so you know roughly what we are talking about, and where to refer back to when you need to:":{}}}],["lot",{"_index":963,"link":{"/zh_TW/coordination/tm-user/#--**completion**-where-you-will-later-indicate-why-you-have-left-this-task,-such-as-you-have-completed-the-required-mapping,-or-you-were-unable-to-finish-it-for-some-reason---make-sure-you-leave-a-message-indicating-why,-such-as-\"-*run-out-of-time,-i've-done-all-of-the-top-half-of-the-square,-but-there-is-a-lot-more-to-be-done-in-the-bottom-half*-\"-before-you-select-**select-another-task**.@@@@- **COMPLETION** where you will later indicate why you have left this task, such as you have completed the required mapping, or you were unable to finish it for some reason - make sure you leave a message indicating why, such as \" *Run out of time, I've done all of the top half of the square, but there is a lot more to be done in the bottom half* \" before you select **Select another Task**.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/zh_TW/mobile-mapping/gpsessentials/#using-portable-maps@@@@Using Portable Maps":{},"/zh_TW/mobile-mapping/gpsessentials/#using-google-maps@@@@Using Google Maps":{},"/zh_TW/coordination/review/#--have-the-pois-been-mapped-in-all-locations?@@@@- Have the POIs been mapped in all locations?":{},"/zh_TW/coordination/review/#--next-make-sure-that-nothing-is-selected-by-clicking-in-a-blank-spot-on-your-map.-if-you-have-features-selected-when-you-run-the-validation-tool,-only-those-selected-features-will-be-checked.-(sometimes-you-may-want-to-only-check-certain-features,-but-for-now-we-will-check-the-entire-file)@@@@- Next make sure that nothing is selected by clicking in a blank spot on your map.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/zh_TW/coordination/review/#--this-is-an-error-that-we-never-would-have-caught-without-the-validation-tool.-if-you-zoom-in-very-close-you-can-see-that-there-is-a-tiny-overlap-between-the-buildings,-which-is-a-topological-error,-because-buildings-don’t-usually-overlap-with-each-other.-to-fix-this,-the-middle-node-needs-to-be-moved.-if-the-buildings-are-actually-touching,-which-they-probably-are,-the-middle-node-can-be-joined-to-the-way.@@@@- This is an error that we never would have caught without the validation tool.
