When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/pt/coordination/mapathon/#--experience-taught-us-that-the-learning-curve-for-people-with-no-mapping-experience-whatsoever-is-very-steep-and-can-be-off-putting-and-frustrating-for-these-newcomers-if-they-cannot-get-some-mapping-done-on-their-first-event.-it-is-important-to-get-them-mapping-as-quickly-as-possible,-so-they-were-shown-just-the-very-basics-with-the-simpler-id-editor,-letting-them-encounter-their-own-particular-problems-during-the-course-of-the-evening-when-they-were-able-to-ask-for-help.@@@@-   Experience taught us that the learning curve for people with no mapping experience whatsoever is very steep and can be off putting and frustrating for these newcomers if they cannot get some mapping done on their first event.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/pt/coordination/tasking-manager3-project-admin/#draw-an-area-of-interest-to-be-mapped@@@@Draw an area of interest to be mapped":{},"/pt/coordination/tasking-manager3-project-admin/#upload-a-geojson-or-kml-file-of-the-area-of-interest-to-be-mapped@@@@Upload a GeoJSON or KML file of the area of interest to be mapped  ":{},"/pt/coordination/tasking-manager3-project-admin/#--a-brand-new-mapper-at-a-mapathon-will-map-an-area-at-roughly-a-quarter-of-the-speed-of-an-experienced-mapper-(many-start-off-far-slower,-but-soon-get-faster),.@@@@-  A brand new mapper at a mapathon will map an area at roughly a quarter of the speed of an experienced mapper (many start off far slower, but soon get faster),.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/pt/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--if-you-would-like-to-empty-the-track-log-to-delete-earlier-recordings,-use-the-joystick-to-select-“clear”,-and-press-the-joystick-down.-the-bar-at-the-top-should-read-“0%”.@@@@-   If you would like to empty the track log to delete earlier recordings, use the joystick to select “Clear”, and press the joystick down.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{}}}],["x",{"_index":1317,"link":{"/pt/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--the-gps-has-different-screens-and-menus-that-allow-you-to-do-different-things.-to-switch-between-screens,-press-the-button-marked-“x”,-just-above-the-power-button-on-the-right-side-of-the-device.-this-button-also-serves-to-go-back.-if-you-press-something-by-mistake-and-would-like-to-cancel-or-go-back,-press-the-“x”-button.@@@@-   The GPS has different screens and menus that allow you to do different things.
