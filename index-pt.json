You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/pt/coordination/tasking-manager3-project-admin/#--description---used-for-display-in-lists-and-motivational-information-for-mappers@@@@- Description - Used for display in lists and motivational information for mappers":{},"/pt/mobile-mapping/field-papers/#now-can-load-your-field-paper-into-josm-and-use-it-to-add-the-information-you-collected-to-openstreetmap.-unless-you-still-have-the-web-page-with-your-snapshots-open-or-stored-a-bookmark-to-it,-return-to-the-field-papers-website,-by-typing-[fieldpapers.org](http://fieldpapers.org/)-in-your-web-browser,-just-as-before.@@@@Now can load your Field Paper into JOSM and use it to add the information you collected to OpenStreetMap.

These are known as tags. Tags are information that is tied to a point, line or shape that describes what it is. We’ll learn more about tags in a later chapter.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/pt/mobile-mapping/gpslogger/#to-other-options@@@@to other options":{}}}],["our",{"_index":788,"link":{"/pt/josm/start-josm/#--you-may-notice-that-when-you-select-an-object,-a-list-appears-to-the-right-of-the-map-in-a-window-called-“properties”.-these-are-known-as-tags.-tags-are-information-that-is-tied-to-a-point,-line-or-shape-that-describes-what-it-is.-we’ll-learn-more-about-tags-in-a-later-chapter.-for-now-all-you-need-to-know-is-that-this-information-helps-describe-whether-our-object-is-a-forest,-a-river,-a-building,-or-something-else.@@@@-   You may notice that when you select an object, a list appears to the right of the map in a window called “Properties”.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/pt/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--if-you-would-like-to-empty-the-track-log-to-delete-earlier-recordings,-use-the-joystick-to-select-“clear”,-and-press-the-joystick-down.-the-bar-at-the-top-should-read-“0%”.@@@@-   If you would like to empty the track log to delete earlier recordings, use the joystick to select “Clear”, and press the joystick down.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/pt/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--gpsbabel-is-a-program-that-allows-us-to-copy-data-from-the-gps.-if-you-have-a-copy-of-gpsbabel-on-a-cd-or-usb-flash-drive,-you-can-skip-to-the-next-section.@@@@-   GPSBabel is a program that allows us to copy data from the GPS.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/pt/coordination/mapathon/#--experience-taught-us-that-the-learning-curve-for-people-with-no-mapping-experience-whatsoever-is-very-steep-and-can-be-off-putting-and-frustrating-for-these-newcomers-if-they-cannot-get-some-mapping-done-on-their-first-event.-it-is-important-to-get-them-mapping-as-quickly-as-possible,-so-they-were-shown-just-the-very-basics-with-the-simpler-id-editor,-letting-them-encounter-their-own-particular-problems-during-the-course-of-the-evening-when-they-were-able-to-ask-for-help.@@@@-   Experience taught us that the learning curve for people with no mapping experience whatsoever is very steep and can be off putting and frustrating for these newcomers if they cannot get some mapping done on their first event.
