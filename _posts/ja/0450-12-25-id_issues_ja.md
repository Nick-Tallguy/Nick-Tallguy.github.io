The Essentials
--------------

![issues][]

The iD editor contains a 'checking feature' which can show potential problems with any area you are viewing. If you are mapping a square on the Tasking manager, you may wish to alter the settings so that you see potential errors for **everything** and **within view**, so that you are able to check that there are no existing problems to be cleared before you begin your own mapping. Be careful that the issue that iD highlights is actually within your allocated square.  

### Warnings from iD (Issues) ###

### Warnings at any time ![id issues icon]{: height="24px"}

![id issues][]

![id issues everywhere][]

In the first image only the mappers own edits are shown - there are no issues, but there is a warning that a potential issue exists. The second image shows all potential issues everywhere in view, and warns of the highway / building overlap which has been previously mapped and saved by someone.  

![Error][]

### マッピング中のエラー警告

iDエディタは編集中に間違いがあった場合にも、指摘のためのエラー警告を表示させます。例えば、道路と建物を交差させてしまったい場合などです。

![warn when mapping][]
