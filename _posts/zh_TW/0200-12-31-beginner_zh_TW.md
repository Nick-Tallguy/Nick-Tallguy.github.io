================

> Reviewed 2015-07-12  

初學者指南將會導引你一步一步進入開放街圖的世界。你會學會 會如何申請帳號，如何使用地圖繪圖軟體，以及如何到外實地探查 並且收集資料放入地圖 

### Are you new to OpenStreetMap and want to improve the map by adding data?

如果你想要開始編輯地圖，我們推薦你可以閱讀這些手冊：
- the [introduction](/en/beginner/introduction/) gives you some background about the project
- [Getting started](/en/beginner/start-osm/) shows you how to get an account and how to invoke an editor
- in [iD editor](/en/beginner/id-editor/) you learn the basics of editing the data


### You already know how to use an editor and want to contribute to Humanitarian Mapping?

The main point is to learn how mapping in this context is coordinated.
- the [remote mapping guide](/en/coordination/HOT-Remote-Response-Guide/) and the general information about [humanitarian mapping](/en/coordination/humanitarian/) provide some background
- the workhorse is the [Tasking Manager](/en/coordination/tm-user/) whose workflow you should get familiar with

### Would you like to use OpenStreetMap on mobile devices?

There is a whole chapter devoted to [mobile mapping](/en/mobile-mapping/)


### You are familiar with GIS tools and want access to the raw data?

The guides on [where to obtain data](/en/osm-data/getting-data/) and [how to use Geofabrik and HOT Export](/en/osm-data/geofabrik-and-hot-export/) should provide some pointers how to extract data in various formats from the database.
