StreetComplete
==============


**StreetComplete** is an easy to use OpenStreetMap editor for Android phones and tablets, used for mapping in the field mainly by completing the available "quests" that appear as pins on a map.

The app is made specifically for casual contributors and beginners as no prior knowledge about OpenStreetMap (such as tagging schemes) is required to contribute using the app.

You can download it from Google Play Store, Amazon or F-Droid. Release and beta APKs of the app are also available from its GitHub repository.

The app displays places where data can be added to OpenStreetMap through the app as quest pins on a map. This app lists all question types available in a particular place depending on the already available data on OpenStreetMap.

**Adding Data to OpenStreetMap Using StreetComplete**

What are quests? Quests are simply points or places that have been identified as having missing data and are available depending on location.

The questions asked depend on the missing information and the feature whose information is missing 

![建構任務][]

For example, for buildings, one could be asked about ***How many levels above the basement does this building have?*** or ***What kind of building is this?***

For roads, ***What surface does this piece of road have?***

To fill in some of this information, you need to either have prior knowledge about the building, place or be close enough to be able to answer the questions being asked.
