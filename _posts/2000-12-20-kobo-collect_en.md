Kobo Collect - KoBoToolbox - surveys with a mobile phone
============

<!-- > This guide may be downloaded as [kobo_en.odt](/files/kobo_en.odt) or [kobo_en.pdf](/files/kobo_en.pdf)  

Kobo Collect is a mobile phone app. designed to be used for data collection. It is part of the open source <http://www.kobotoolbox.org/> suite of tools and a more detailed explanation of the suite of tools can be obtained from the website. KoBoToolbox was based upon OpenDataKit (ODK) and many modules are interchangeable. The creation of a survey using a spreadsheet programme may be difficult, and KoBoToolbox overcomes this by providing a simple web interface - this guide provides a simple explanation of how to use this web interface to create your survey.  

Planning your survey - the data you need
--------------------
Many surveys have been carried out throughout the world using ODK or Kobo collect, and a simple web search to see if an existing survey is freely available may save you a little work. However, if you are taking the time to obtain and train staff, plan their areas for the survey, and make sure they will be safe and well recieved, it is also wise to make sure they obtain all of the data you may require during one visit. Although this guide is aimed at obtaining data for updating OpenStreetMap, you may also obtain contact details or more detailed medical information which you retain for your purposes and do not upload to OpenStreetMap.  

Your aim is to obtain data, and your initial design will be based upon the data you wish to obtain, for instance;  

+  exact location (*this will be obtained using the gps within the mobile phone, and may take severeal seconds or in extreme cases about a minute, for the phone to obtain*).  
+  name of the village  
+  name of the road  

+  what is the best method of travel to the village?  
+  if the river is in flood, is there an alternative route?  

+  name of the local contact,  
+  best method of contact, ie phone, radio, letter drop,  
+  alternative method of contact  

+  is there a drinking water supply in the village?  
+  turbidity of the water  
+  pH value of the water  
+  proximity of the water supply to a toilet  
+  is the water supply available throughout the whole year?  

+  Approximately how many people live in the village?  
+  are there any other medical facilities available?  

Planning the survey for the enumerator or data collector
-------------------------------------------------------

Your data collector needs to understand the local area and customs. It is very likely that on first arriving in a village they should approach a person of standing in the community, possible to be found in a central building. They will wish to introduce themselves and explain what they are trying to achieve. It is likely they will be invited into a building (the phone gps will not work well within a building, and may not work at all).
