> Mise Ã  jour le 2015-07-12

OpenStreetMap Contributors spend the bulk of their time editing. The more you edit, the better you get, and the more you learn. This section of learnOSM contains tutorials that will help you learn about editing with JOSM, which is the preferred editor for many mappers and is far more configurable than iD.
