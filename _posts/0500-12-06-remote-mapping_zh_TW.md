# HOT 遠端支援指南

人道救援開放街圖小組 (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team, HOT) 是一個運用開源和開放資料原則在人道救援和經濟發展的全球社群。  

### 遠端支援是如何實現的呢？

HOT 主要的反應活動大都在遠端進行。災難發生後，HOT 的成員搜尋已有的資料，還有衛星影像。相關的合作伙伴已經簽約要提供 ODbL 授權相容的影像。一旦取得影像，全球的數位社群開始數位化資料，或是從影像描繪 (一般來說，主要著重在辨識在人道救援行動時有用的物件，像是道路、建築、中斷的道路、洪水等) 產生資料和地圖。在這段時間時，救難單位也同時被諮詢決定什麼是需要做的事情。  

Considering the scale of the crisis, HOT allocates the necessary resources and the response is coordinated by a specific team or member who makes sure everyone knows when new resources are available as well as where to focus efforts. HOT fosters the engagement of the OSM community and, if existing, local actors to use tools like the Tasking Manager to coordinate response efforts. Examples include the remote activities done in Ivory Coast, Senegal, Philippines, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

### HOT 工作管理員 

The [HOT Tasking Manager](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) is a open source tool designed to divide up a mapping job into smaller tasks that can be completed rapidly. It shows which areas need to be mapped and which areas need the mapping validated by others. It includes mapping tasks for [Activations](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/HOT_activation), and longer standing [Humanitarian Projects](http://hot.openstreetmap.org/projects).  

In order to use the HOT Tasking Manager you need to sign up with OpenStreetMap (OSM) with a username and password. For more instructions read the [Tasking Manager Tutorial](http://learnosm.org/en/coordination/tasking-manager/).

### 編輯工具 

[iD](http://learnosm.org/en/beginner/id-editor/) - the web-based editor created by [Mapbox](www.mapbox.com) with a very user-friendly interface. Generally considered the best editing tool to start with. You can launch this [interactive iD editor tutorial](http://ideditor.com/) to get acquainted with how to use it.

[JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/)- a Java app pronounced as "Jaws-um", which requires downloading the app and has a greater learning curve. Although it takes longer to setup and learn, it is super-fast for making more edits. Using a mouse is recommended for using this editor.

### 忠告和鼓勵的話

> "To practice it's recommended you start with a local area you know and try some editing, such as updating a local building in your neighborhood."  
> "Some tasks are easier than others; if you don't feel up to one of them, simply cancel out and try another!" -Peter (@meetar)  
> "It's no problem if you don't finish the task; just upload what you've done and unlock the task so others can work on it." -Peter (@meetar)  
> "If you'd like to see examples of the quality of work that passes muster, check out one of the green "validated" tasks. Don't worry, clicking the "Review the work" button doesn't commit you to anything – it just locks the task as though you were editing it. Load it like normal, and simply unlock the task again when you're done." -Peter (@meetar)  
> "The satellite pictures are sometimes difficult to interpret, but don't worry too much about drawing the perfect line or shape – your work will be reviewed and modified by others, and improved with time. And remember, these are crisis areas, not tax records or voting districts – these maps will be read by people who may be in a hurry, in the dark, or in danger. In West Africa, even a rough line on a map is an expression of hope. In Gaza, many of the buildings to be mapped are already gone; but we mark the fact of their construction. Accuracy is nice, but it isn't the point." -Peter (@meetar)
