Identification
---------------

Round buildings are often found within a compound, and the buildings may be in clusters, or in isolation. It can be difficult to establish if you are looking at a round building or a bush or rock. Buildings are usually found near some means of access such as a path or track, although this can be difficult to see on very hard ground. The vegetation may be worn down by the passage of feet. In some parts of the world the buildings may be on the only dry land, and the access is by boat on a river or lake. There is normally a water source visible within 2 or 3 kilometres of any habitation, but in many parts of the world you do not see the water, but you do see more vegetation to indicate it must be there.  

![bush-and-round-building][]  
This image shows both a bush and a round building. Shadows can help you to identify if you are looking at a round building, or a bush. In hot climates it is common to find buildings close to trees or bushes which will provide shelter and shade. The instructions to this particular task include a [link to a diary entry](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/IvanGayton/diary/38612) by someone who has taken photographs of the buildings in the area, and gives a description. Please take the time to read this information. Round buildings can have slightly different construction materials in other areas of the world, and their roofs will appear different - the project instructions will often include guides to help you understand what you are seeing.  
Do your best - even the experts will disagree sometimes, and sometimes you just have to go there to see exactly what is really there. **If in doubt add it as a building.**  

Building Tags
-------------

As we are tagging buildings we have never visited and are not familiar with, the safest and recommended tagging scheme is **building**=**yes** which you can see on a correctly tagged building if scroll to the bottom of the tagging pane and click on **All tags**.
