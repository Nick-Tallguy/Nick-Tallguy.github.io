# Tasking Manager API

The Tasking Manager (TM) API is meant for software developers to interact with the Tasking Manager database.

However, it is also useful for regular (non developer) users. It enables them to retrieve information from the Tasking Manager database that is not (directly) available through the TM itself. The interface to the API can be found [within the TM](https://tasks.hotosm.org/api-docs/)

To retrieve information from the API often an API key is needed. You find that on your settings page.

Look for queries (also called "endpoints") that start with "GET". These will pull (get) information from the TM database. The result (called response) is in JSON format, a structured way of storing information as plain text, understandable for computers and for humans. It is a bit like a shopping list or a recipe.

The workflow is as follows:
* Copy your API key from [your settings page](https://tasks.hotosm.org/settings)
* Click on the link with text “API Documentation”
* On [the API docs page](https://tasks.hotosm.org/api-docs/) scroll to the query/endpoint of your choice 
* Click on the button with the text “Try it out”
* If needed, paste your API key in the textbox near “Authorization”. Attention: you first need to delete the text “Token session TokenHere==” 
* Fill in the necessary fields
* Click the button with text “Execute”
* Check the results in the box with the title “Response body”
* Click on the button with text “Download”. You can save the Response as a JSON file or open it in an editor of your choice

An overview of all "GET" endpoints: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AZe7Ax_Y6Cd4WTHH2RFCVLfmkstXQLNAPdfi0H7rwwA/edit#gid=0>

Some additional information:
* It is not always necessary to fill in all text fields
* User_id: can be found eg in OSMCha and the “osmChange XML” file
* The page field can be left empty
* The page_size field reflects the number of individual results you get
* Format date in the YYYY-MM-DD format
