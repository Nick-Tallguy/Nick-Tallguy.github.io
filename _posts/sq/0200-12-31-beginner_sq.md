Guida e fillestarëve
================

> Reviewed 2015-07-12  

Kjo guidë tregon hap pas hapi se si të nisni me OpenStreetMap. Ju do të mësoni si të krijoni një llogari, si të përdorni programe bazikë për editimin e hartave dhe në kapitujt më vonë ju mund të mësoni si të dilni jashtë 

### Are you new to OpenStreetMap and want to improve the map by adding data?

If you want to get started and be able to edit the map data then we recommend that you read these guides:
- the [introduction](/en/beginner/introduction/) gives you some background about the project
- [Getting started](/en/beginner/start-osm/) shows you how to get an account and how to invoke an editor
- in [iD editor](/en/beginner/id-editor/) you learn the basics of editing the data


### You already know how to use an editor and want to contribute to Humanitarian Mapping?

The main point is to learn how mapping in this context is coordinated.
- the [remote mapping guide](/en/coordination/HOT-Remote-Response-Guide/) and the general information about [humanitarian mapping](/en/coordination/humanitarian/) provide some background
- the workhorse is the [Tasking Manager](/en/coordination/tm-user/) whose workflow you should get familiar with

### Would you like to use OpenStreetMap on mobile devices?

There is a whole chapter devoted to [mobile mapping](/en/mobile-mapping/)


### You are familiar with GIS tools and want access to the raw data?

The guides on [where to obtain data](/en/osm-data/getting-data/) and [how to use Geofabrik and HOT Export](/en/osm-data/geofabrik-and-hot-export/) should provide some pointers how to extract data in various formats from the database.
