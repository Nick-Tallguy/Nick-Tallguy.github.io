iD 編輯器 - 儲存
------------------

### 使用 iD 編輯器儲存的基本操作 ###

![saving][]

> 這張圖片 ![keymon]{: height="24px"} 顯示你可以用那個按鈕，滑鼠的滾輪，或是按那個鍵築的按鈕。  

點擊 ![save-icon]{: height="24px"} 圖示，點擊了之後就會儲存，之後加上變更組合備註 (主題標籤？)，接著點擊 ![upload]{: height="24px"} 圖示儲存你的變動到開放街圖。  

### 儲存或上傳到開放街圖 - 詳細說明 ###

經常儲存你的工作，也許是畫了 6 棟建築。當你在圖客趴上有很多人同時間同一地工作時，經常儲存是相當重要的事情。  

如果你需要在你的貢獻上加上 #主題標籤 的話，圖片中顯示的變動組合的備註部分是可以寫上去的地方。而且可以在備註結尾處加上簡單的描述你做了什麼，例如說"**新增了一些建築**"。  

如果要看更多關於變動組合備註部分，請見  <https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments>  

Your edits will appear on <http://www.openstreetmap.org> within a few seconds.  

Although your changes are accepted by OpenStreetMap within a few seconds, some programmes, apps. and devices use a saved version of OpenStreetMap which may not be updated for some weeks or months.  

Tasking Manager - Finishing a square, or stopping work before the square is finished  
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When you think the square is finished, return to the Tasking Manager tab on your browser, add a comment & mark the square as complete. Do not copy the changeset comment with hashtags which you used when saving.  
![mark task as done]{: height="250px"}  

如果你選擇；

- **Mark task as done** the square you were working on will turn yellow to show it is complete and awaiting validation.  
- **Stop Mapping** the square will return to it's white or pale grey colour to show it needs more work. It is very helpful if your comment lets the next mapper know what needs to be done, such as  
    - "There are more buildings to trace in the bottom right corner of the square, but I've run out of time"  

The whole Tasking Manager process only works if mappers mark squares as complete - even if you are very new and not sure, when you think it is complete, click on the **Mark task as done** button. The worst thing that can happen is that someone thinks there is a lot more to be done and invalidates your square. Most of us that have carried out a lot of mapping on the Task Manager have had at least one square invalidated. *Sometimes the mapper who invalidated a square is wrong - perhaps they should have just completed the few things that were needed. - We all miss something at some point.*  

OpenStreetMap has evolved because mappers are constantly improving the information. Sometimes new imagery becomes available making more detailed mapping possible, and sometimes a survey takes place and information is gained and added to the map.   

### Task Manager - sending a message to another Task Manager user ###
You can send a message from this box to another Tasking Manager user by using **@** followed by the username - for instance "Thanks for your work on this @Tallguy I noticed you were having problems with round buildings - this link may help http://learnosm.org/en/hot-tips/tracing-round-buildings/. Keep up the good work! Regards Nick"
