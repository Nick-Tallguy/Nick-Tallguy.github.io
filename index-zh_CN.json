When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{}}}],["below",{"_index":312,"link":{"/zh_CN/beginner/start-osm/#--if-you-have-a-mouse-with-a-scroll-wheel,-zoom-in-and-out-on-the-map-by-turning-the-wheel.-if-you-don’t-have-a-scroll-wheel,-use-the-+-and-–-buttons-on-the-upper-right-corner-of-the-map.-(see-figure-below)@@@@-   If you have a mouse with a scroll-wheel, zoom in and out on the map by turning the wheel.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{}}}],["lot",{"_index":405,"link":{"/zh_CN/coordination/tm-user/#--**completion**-where-you-will-later-indicate-why-you-have-left-this-task,-such-as-you-have-completed-the-required-mapping,-or-you-were-unable-to-finish-it-for-some-reason---make-sure-you-leave-a-message-indicating-why,-such-as-\"-*run-out-of-time,-i've-done-all-of-the-top-half-of-the-square,-but-there-is-a-lot-more-to-be-done-in-the-bottom-half*-\"-before-you-select-**select-another-task**.@@@@- **COMPLETION** where you will later indicate why you have left this task, such as you have completed the required mapping, or you were unable to finish it for some reason - make sure you leave a message indicating why, such as \" *Run out of time, I've done all of the top half of the square, but there is a lot more to be done in the bottom half* \" before you select **Select another Task**.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{}}}],["number",{"_index":297,"link":{"/zh_CN/osm-data/osm-in-qgis/#--click-\"load-from-db\"-to-see-a-list-of-all-the-available-tags-in-the-database.-expand-the-window-size-by-dragging-the-corner-if-that-helps.-you-can-see-all-the-tags-contained-in-this-data,-and-also-the-number-of-features-that-have-each-tag.@@@@- Click \"Load from DB\" to see a list of all the available tags in the database.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/zh_CN/josm/editing-with-josm/#--you-should-see-the-layer-that-you-selected-disappear-in-the-map-window.-click-show/hide-again,-and-it-will-reappear.@@@@-   You should see the layer that you selected disappear in the map window.

These are known as tags. Tags are information that is tied to a point, line or shape that describes what it is. We’ll learn more about tags in a later chapter. For now all you need to know is that this information helps describe whether our object is a forest, a river, a building, or something else.":{},"/zh_CN/josm/start-josm/#修改对象@@@@修改对象":{},"/zh_CN/josm/start-josm/#绘图@@@@绘图":{},"/zh_CN/josm/start-josm/#--before-you-draw,-you-need-to-make-sure-that-nothing-is-selected.-click-in-the-black-space-on-the-map,-where-it-is-empty,-to-make-sure-nothing-is-selected.@@@@-   Before you draw, you need to make sure that nothing is selected.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/zh_CN/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--if-you-would-like-to-empty-the-track-log-to-delete-earlier-recordings,-use-the-joystick-to-select-“clear”,-and-press-the-joystick-down.-the-bar-at-the-top-should-read-“0%”.@@@@-   If you would like to empty the track log to delete earlier recordings, use the joystick to select “Clear”, and press the joystick down.
