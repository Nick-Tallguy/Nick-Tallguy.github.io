You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{}}}],["courtyar",{"_index":1259,"link":{"/hu/hot-tips/tagging/#relations---such-as-buildings-with-a-courtyard-or-islands-in-a-river@@@@Relations - such as buildings with a courtyard or islands in a river ":{}}}],["creat",{"_index":927,"link":{"/hu/josm/more-about-josm/#--draw-a-box-around-the-area-that-you-want-to-download.-to-draw-a-new-box,-click-on-the-map,-hold-your-left-mouse-button-down,-and-drag-your-mouse-to-create-a-box.-release-the-mouse-button-to-finish-drawing-the-box.@@@@-   Draw a box around the area that you want to download.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/hu/josm/more-about-josm/#--draw-a-box-around-the-area-that-you-want-to-download.-to-draw-a-new-box,-click-on-the-map,-hold-your-left-mouse-button-down,-and-drag-your-mouse-to-create-a-box.-release-the-mouse-button-to-finish-drawing-the-box.@@@@-   Draw a box around the area that you want to download.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/hu/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--if-you-would-like-to-empty-the-track-log-to-delete-earlier-recordings,-use-the-joystick-to-select-“clear”,-and-press-the-joystick-down.-the-bar-at-the-top-should-read-“0%”.@@@@-   If you would like to empty the track log to delete earlier recordings, use the joystick to select “Clear”, and press the joystick down.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/hu/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--first,-turn-off-the-track-log-on-your-gps,-by-going-to-the-track-page-and-selecting-“off”.@@@@-   First, turn off the track log on your GPS, by going to the track page and selecting “Off”.":{},"/hu/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--gpsbabel-is-a-program-that-allows-us-to-copy-data-from-the-gps.-if-you-have-a-copy-of-gpsbabel-on-a-cd-or-usb-flash-drive,-you-can-skip-to-the-next-section.@@@@-   GPSBabel is a program that allows us to copy data from the GPS.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/hu/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--first,-turn-off-the-track-log-on-your-gps,-by-going-to-the-track-page-and-selecting-“off”.@@@@-   First, turn off the track log on your GPS, by going to the track page and selecting “Off”.":{},"/hu/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--locate-the-gpsbabel-setup-file-on-your-computer.-double-click-it-to-install.@@@@-   Locate the GPSBabel setup file on your computer.
