You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{}}}],["courtyard",{"_index":1574,"link":{"/en/hot-tips/tagging/#relations---such-as-buildings-with-a-courtyard-or-islands-in-a-river@@@@Relations - such as buildings with a courtyard or islands in a river ":{}}}],["cr",{"_index":891,"link":{"/en/osm-data/osm2pgsql/#--select-one-or-more-of-the-layers-and-click-\"add.\"-if-asked,-choose-wgs84-as-the-crs.@@@@- Select one or more of the layers and click \"Add.\" If asked, choose WGS84 as the CRS.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/en/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--if-you-would-like-to-empty-the-track-log-to-delete-earlier-recordings,-use-the-joystick-to-select-“clear”,-and-press-the-joystick-down.-the-bar-at-the-top-should-read-“0%”.@@@@-   If you would like to empty the track log to delete earlier recordings, use the joystick to select “Clear”, and press the joystick down.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/en/josm/editing-with-josm/#--lastly,-it’s-important-to-know-that-you-can-only-edit-the-layer-that-is-considered-*active*-by-josm.-if-you-are-unable-to-edit-the-map-in-your-map-window,-it’s-probably-because-you-don’t-have-the-correct-layer-set-as-active.-most-layers,-such-as-gps-points,-field-papers,-and-satellite-imagery,-can’t-be-edited.-the-only-layers-that-can-be-edited-are-data-from-openstreetmap,-which-are-usually-called-“data-layer-1”.@@@@-   Lastly, it’s important to know that you can only edit the layer that is considered *active* by JOSM.

If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{}}}],["level",{"_index":443,"link":{"/en/coordination/tasking-manager3-project-admin/#logging-in-&amp;-access-levels@@@@Logging in &amp; Access Levels":{},"/en/coordination/tasking-manager3-project-admin/#access-levels-within-the-osm-tasking-manager@@@@Access Levels within the OSM Tasking Manager":{},"/en/coordination/tasking-manager-project-admin/#logging-in-&amp;-access-levels@@@@Logging in &amp; Access Levels":{},"/en/coordination/tasking-manager-project-admin/#access-levels-within-the-osm-tasking-manager@@@@Access Levels within the OSM Tasking Manager":{},"/en/coordination/tasking-manager-project-admin/#the-osm-tasking-manager-has-three-user-access-levels:@@@@The OSM Tasking Manager has three user access levels:":{},"/en/@@@@\"OpenStreetMap is a free street level map of the world, created by an ever growing community of mappers.\"":{}}}],["levels:@@@@th",{"_index":1404,"link":{"/en/coordination/tasking-manager-project-admin/#the-osm-tasking-manager-has-three-user-access-levels:@@@@The OSM Tasking Manager has three user access levels:":{}}}],["levels@@@@log",{"_index":442,"link":{"/en/coordination/tasking-manager3-project-admin/#logging-in-&amp;-access-levels@@@@Logging in &amp; Access Levels":{},"/en/coordination/tasking-manager-project-admin/#logging-in-&amp;-access-levels@@@@Logging in &amp; Access Levels":{}}}],["librari",{"_index":1397,"link":{"/en/case-studies/kobo-formbuilder-1/#kobo-library@@@@Kobo library":{},"/en/case-studies/kobo-formbuilder/#kobo-library@@@@Kobo library":{}}}],["library@@@@kobo",{"_index":1396,"link":{"/en/case-studies/kobo-formbuilder-1/#kobo-library@@@@Kobo library":{},"/en/case-studies/kobo-formbuilder/#kobo-library@@@@Kobo library":{}}}],["libreoffic",{"_index":281,"link":{"/en/josm/opendata-plugin/#--open-the-spreadsheet-in-an-opensource-programme-such-as-libreoffice-which-is-available-for-most-operating-systems-<http://www.libreoffice.org/>,@@@@- Open the spreadsheet in an opensource programme such as LibreOffice which is available for most operating systems <http://www.libreoffice.org/>,  ":{}}}],["line",{"_index":126,"link":{"/en/coordination/editing_the_wiki/#--a-line-with-the-first-two-characters-'{|'-indicating-the-begin-of-a@@@@- A line with the first two characters '{|' indicating the begin of a":{},"/en/josm/start-josm/#points,-lines,-and-shapes@@@@Points, Lines, and Shapes":{},"/en/josm/start-josm/#--you-may-notice-that-when-you-select-an-object,-a-list-appears-to-the-right-of-the-map-in-a-window-called-“properties”.-these-are-known-as-tags.-tags-are-information-that-is-tied-to-a-point,-line-or-shape-that-describes-what-it-is.-we’ll-learn-more-about-tags-in-a-later-chapter.-for-now-all-you-need-to-know-is-that-this-information-helps-describe-whether-our-object-is-a-forest,-a-river,-a-building,-or-something-else.@@@@-   You may notice that when you select an object, a list appears to the right of the map in a window called “Properties”.

If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/en/coordination/remote/#take-a-few-minutes-to-look-at-each-of-these---just-a-quick-read-so-you-know-roughly-what-we-are-talking-about,-and-where-to-refer-back-to-when-you-need-to:@@@@Take a few minutes to look at each of these - just a quick read so you know roughly what we are talking about, and where to refer back to when you need to:":{}}}],["lot",{"_index":801,"link":{"/en/coordination/tm-user/#--**completion**-where-you-will-later-indicate-why-you-have-left-this-task,-such-as-you-have-completed-the-required-mapping,-or-you-were-unable-to-finish-it-for-some-reason---make-sure-you-leave-a-message-indicating-why,-such-as-\"-*run-out-of-time,-i've-done-all-of-the-top-half-of-the-square,-but-there-is-a-lot-more-to-be-done-in-the-bottom-half*-\"-before-you-select-**select-another-task**.@@@@- **COMPLETION** where you will later indicate why you have left this task, such as you have completed the required mapping, or you were unable to finish it for some reason - make sure you leave a message indicating why, such as \" *Run out of time, I've done all of the top half of the square, but there is a lot more to be done in the bottom half* \" before you select **Select another Task**.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/en/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--if-you-would-like-to-empty-the-track-log-to-delete-earlier-recordings,-use-the-joystick-to-select-“clear”,-and-press-the-joystick-down.-the-bar-at-the-top-should-read-“0%”.@@@@-   If you would like to empty the track log to delete earlier recordings, use the joystick to select “Clear”, and press the joystick down.

If you are unable to edit the map in your map window, it’s probably because you don’t have the correct layer set as active. Most layers, such as GPS points, Field Papers, and satellite imagery, can’t be edited.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped.

If the buildings are actually touching, which they probably are, the middle node can be joined to the way.":{},"/en/coordination/review/#--there-are-a-great-many-types-of-query-you-can-search-here,-and-you-can-see-details-and-examples-in-the-search-box-itself-and-by-clicking-on-the-“help”-button.@@@@- There are a great many types of query you can search here, and you can see details and examples in the search box itself and by clicking on the “Help” button.":{},"/en/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--you-can-see-on-this-page-some-information-about-the-waypoint-that-you-are-saving.-first-is-the-name.-if-this-is-your-first-waypoint,-it-probably-reads-“001”.-this-is-the-number-you-should-record-on-paper-along-with-the-information-you-want-to-collect-with-this-object.-next-you-will-see-the-time-and-date-when-the-point-is-recorded.-below-that-are-the-coordinates,-followed-by-the-altitude.@@@@-   You can see on this page some information about the waypoint that you are saving.

When the track log is turned on, it will automatically record your path. It’s good practice to turn on the log when you begin mapping, and turn it off when you are finished. You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{},"/en/case-studies/kobo-formbuilder-1/#gps---the-enumerator-will-see@@@@GPS - The enumerator will see":{},"/en/josm/editing-with-josm/#--you-should-see-the-layer-that-you-selected-disappear-in-the-map-window.-click-show/hide-again,-and-it-will-reappear.@@@@-   You should see the layer that you selected disappear in the map window.

You will then be able to look at the track on a computer and see the path that you mapped. If you would like to map the course of a road, it is a good idea to save a waypoint at the beginning and end of the road, writing in your notebook the name and type of the road, and any other important information about the road.":{}}}],["x",{"_index":1209,"link":{"/en/mobile-mapping/using-gps/#--the-gps-has-different-screens-and-menus-that-allow-you-to-do-different-things.-to-switch-between-screens,-press-the-button-marked-“x”,-just-above-the-power-button-on-the-right-side-of-the-device.-this-button-also-serves-to-go-back.-if-you-press-something-by-mistake-and-would-like-to-cancel-or-go-back,-press-the-“x”-button.@@@@-   The GPS has different screens and menus that allow you to do different things.
